I am a data scientist at the [Tanzania Fisheries Research Institute](https://tafiri.go.tz/) (TAFIRI), which falls under the [Ministry of Livestock and Fisheries](https://www.mifugouvuvi.go.tz). My primary research interests revolve around artificial intelligence (AI), encompassing machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and natural language processing (NLP), as well as earth observation sciences, geographic information systems (GIS), remote sensing, geospatial analysis, and big data analytics. Specifically, I am deeply passionate about applying machine learning and deep neural network algorithms to develop advanced predictive and forecasting models.

Furthermore, I am enthusiastic about harnessing the power of cloud computing technology to enhance the efficiency and scalability of AI applications. I utilize platforms such as (e.g., [Google Earth Engine](https://earthengine.google.com/), [Digital Earth Africa](https://www.digitalearthafrica.org/) and [WEkEO](https://www.wekeo.eu/ to study environmental changes, particularly in the ocean, land, and atmosphere. My work often involves working with remotely sensed satellite data from sources like Sentinels, Landsat, and MODIS, as well as in-situ data from instruments like CDT, buoys, and Argo Drifters. I employ programming languages such as Python and R for data analysis and modeling.

In addition to my research endeavors, I am a staunch advocate for open science and reproducible research practices. Furthermore, I am actively involved in using TinyML approaches to develop ML models that can run on edge computing devices and embedded systems, expanding the reach and applicability of AI technology.
