I am a data scientist at the [Tanzania Fisheries Research Institute (TAFIRI)](https://tafiri.go.tz/), Ministry of Livestock and Fisheries. My research interests include earth observation sciences. More specifically, I am interested in applying artificial intelligence and machine learning to develop predictive and forecasting models. I am a fan of using cloud computing technology (e.g., [Google Earth Engine](https://earthengine.google.com/)) to study environmental change, especially in the ocean, land, and atmosphere. I frequently use the Python and R programming languages to access and analyze satellite (Sentinels, landsat, and MODIS) and in-situ data (CDT, buoys, and Algo floats). I am a strong advocate of open science and reproducible research. More information about my research can be found on [personal website](https://wetls.io/) and [research blog](https://blog.gish/)
